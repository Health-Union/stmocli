# Introduction

St. Mocli allows you to keep SQL queries in github repositories
and easily deploy to re:dash.

[Re:dash](https://redash.io/)
is great for quickly creating and sharing simple analyses.
However, sometimes we want to **treat our queries like code**.
In re:dash, it's difficult to get review, track revisions, or collaborate on queries.

# Workflow

St. Mocli is currently [vaporware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware),
so this workflow is going to change.

## Start a new query

## Get Review

## Merge and Deploy
